This was a project that I've been considerably interested in since I worked at Kauai Coffee during summer 2017. The problem seemed alluring; in the sense that (1) no one has quite approached the problem using machine learning and (2) this is a tangible problem that a large business has + one that *I could solve. Damn that sounds pretty opportunistic! :) 


### The Problem:
Timing the harvest season for a large coffee orchard is a difficult and specialized task. Without decades of experience, it would be costly to train anyone to oversea/replicate this.

### The Proposed Solution:
Train a supervised machine learning model to identify coffee cherries in a given image + determine its stage of ripeness.
