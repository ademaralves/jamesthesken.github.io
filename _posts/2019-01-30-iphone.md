If you're reading this article, it's because you're interested in learning about full-stack development and how to control hardware from your phone or other networked devices. What started as seeing if I could blink an LED over a serial port opened by Node.js turned into making an iPhone app to do the same. 

## What are the possibilities from knowing this?
1. Anything

## The Hardware Setup
I used the following:
* iPhone
* Arduino Uno with USB cable
* Raspberry Pi running a standalone hotspot

## Software used:
* Expo to simulate iOS (I don't have a Mac)
* React-Native because I like Javascript
* Arduino environment 
* socket.io to broadcast commands accross the network.
* Node.js/Express to handle requests/commands sent to the serial port.

The interfacing of hardware wasn't too hard. Getting socket.io and React-Native to cooperate took the most work however. If you're having trouble with that, check out my [Github repo](https://github.com/jamesthesken/iphone-arduino). Particularly:

```//importing networking
window.navigator.userAgent = 'react-native'; //this NEEDS to be placed before importing socket io
import io from 'socket.io-client/dist/socket.io'; ```

The whole thing works by having the server listen to events broadcasted on port 8080, in the form of a string. The string is received by the serial port and interpreted as different commands. For our case, a blink.
