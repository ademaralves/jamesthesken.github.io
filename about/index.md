Welcome! Hope you check out the rest of the site for more information about my projects and some other things I'm interested in. I grew up on Kauai and surfed everyday for the most part. Send me an e-mail, I'd love to talk.

## What I'm usually working on:
* Machine learning for computer vision.
* Embedded systems with the <a href="https://grogdata.soest.hawaii.edu/project_info/"><b> Marine Embedded Systems Hui at the University of Hawaii. </b></a>
* Drones 

## Some hard skills:
* Python
* HTML & CSS
* Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.
* Tensorflow
* Solidworks
* 3D printing
